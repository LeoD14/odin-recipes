                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare sushi rice: Cook Japanese white rice is mixed with a special sushi rice vinegar.</li>
                    <li>Prepare your sushi rolling mat: Once you have your sushi rice prepared, you will need to begin by laying out a preparation area with your makisu rolling mat.</li>
                    <li>Place a sheet of nori seaweed on the mat: Cover two thirds of one side of your nori seaweed with your sushi rice approximately 1cm high.</li>
                    <li>Add your ingredients in a line on top of the rice in the centre: You can choose any combination of ingredients that compliment each other well. We went for salmon, salad and mayonnaise for this one.</li>
                    <li>Roll your sushi: Now for the fun bit. Using the wooden rolling mat, start rolling up the ingredients away from you, while keeping the roll tight. The moisture from the rice will help it stick together.</li>
                    <li>Cut the sushi roll: You can then cut your roll into 6-8 pieces and serve with some soy sauce, wasabi, sushi ginger and cup of sencha green tea.</li>
