I'm creating this project as a test to start using my coding skills. 

So far, I have completed the CSS, HTML and Javascript fundamentals. For now, I'm still learning the basics for coding with Javascript, and I'm working on basic coding challenges to hone my skills. 

Looking forward to improve in the future.
